**RSMC Tropical Cyclone Information**  
The Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) Tokyo - Typhoon Center provides information on tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific and the South China Sea,including present and forecast positions as well as the movement and intensity of tropical cyclones.
Please note that information issued by the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center represents neither official analysis/forecasts nor warnings for the areas concerned.
*Such official information is issued by the National Meteorological Services of individual countries.

**Notes on RSMC Tropical Cyclone Information**  
Tropical cyclone information includes analyses and forecasts of tropical cyclones. It is provided by the RSMC (Regional Specialized Meteorological Center) Tokyo - Typhoon Center operated by JMA within the framework of the World Weather Watch (WWW) Programme of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). It is primarily issued for National Meteorological Services in Asia and the western North Pacific region to assist them in issuing accurate tropical cyclone forecasting and timely warnings.

**Thresholds of issuance**  
Tropical cyclone information is issued when:
1. a tropical cyclone of tropical storm (TS*) intensity or higher exists in the Center's area of responsibility;
2. a tropical cyclone is expected to reach TS intensity or higher in the area within 24 hours;
3. a tropical cyclone of TS intensity or higher is expected to move into the area within 24 hours.
* A TS is defined as a tropical cyclone with a maximum sustained wind speed of 34 knots or more and less than 48 knot

**Issuance times and forecast periods**  
Information is issued every three hours.
1. Advisories at 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 UTC contain 24-hour, 48-hour, 72-hour, 96-hour and 120-hour forecasts.
2. Advisories at 0300, 0900, 1500 and 2100 UTC contain 24-hour, 45-hour*, 69-hour*, 93-hour* and 117-hour* forecasts.
* 45-hour, 69-hour, 93-hour and 117-hour forecasts are the same as the 48-hour, 72-hour, 96-hour and 120-hour forecasts in the advisories issued 3 hours before.

**Contents**  
Points of analysis:
1. Center position of tropical cyclone
2. Accuracy of center position determination
3. Central pressure
4. Maximum sustained wind speed (10-minute average)
5. Maximum wind gust speed
6. Radii of wind areas over 50 and 30 knots
24-, 48- (45-), 72- (69-), 96- (93-) and 120- (117-) hour forecasts:
7. Center position and radius of probability circle***
8. Direction and speed of movement
9. Central pressure
10. Maximum sustained wind speed (10-minute average)
11. Maximum wind gust speed
* A circular range into which a tropical cyclone is expected to move with a probability of 70% at each valid time.

The dataset is organised and uploaded for my personal first time with the goal of learning, it should be used for learning and sharing and communication purposes, and I am eager to get suggestions from the community.
